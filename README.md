filepack
========

`filepack` is a command-line utility for verifying the integrity of collections
of files.

It is currently unstable: the interface and file format may change at any time.
Additionally, the code has not been extensively reviewed and should be
considered experimental.

Files are hashed using [BLAKE3](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3/), a
fast, cryptographic hash function, and hash digests and file paths are stored
in a manifest file named `filepack.json`.

Files can later be verified against the hashes saved in the manifest to protect
against accidental or malicious corruption, as long as the manifest has not
been tampered with.

Alternatives and Prior Art
--------------------------

`filepack` serves the same purpose as programs like `shasum`, which hash files
and output a text file containing file hashes and paths, which can later be
used with the same program to verify that the files have not changed.

They output hashes and paths one per line, separated by whitespace, and mainly
differ in which hash function they use.

Some examples, with links to implementations and the hash functions they use:

| Binary | Hash Function |
|---|---|
| [`cksfv`](https://zakalwe.fi/~shd/foss/cksfv/) | [CRC-32](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyclic_redundancy_check) |
| [`shasum`](https://metacpan.org/pod/Digest::SHA) | [SHA-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1) and [SHA-2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) |
| [`sha3sum`](https://codeberg.org/maandree/sha3sum) | [SHA-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3) |
| [`b2sum`](https://github.com/BLAKE2/BLAKE2) | [BLAKE2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)#BLAKE2) |
| [`b3sum`](https://github.com/BLAKE3-team/BLAKE3) | [BLAKE3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BLAKE_(hash_function)#BLAKE3) |

CRC-32 is not a cryptographic hash function and cannot be used to detect
intentional modifications. Similarly, SHA-1 was thought to be a cryptographic
hash function, but is now known to be insecure.

`filepack` and `b3sum` both use BLAKE3, a fast, general-purpose cryptographic
hash function.

New Releases

new features.
